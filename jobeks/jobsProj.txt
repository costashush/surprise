      Jobs Platform project
    ----------------------------


In the jobs project you will build a web  aplication that
creates a jobs marketplace.
Developers can search for a job, specify interesting 
area(s) of expertise, and be notified of new jobs that
match their specifications.
Job offers, can define the position requirements, browse 
through possible candidates, and get notification of 
new applications for jobs.
Every user can be both a job offerer and a job seeker.

views:
Create (at least) the following views:
    - user login
        Enter your login credentials

    - user profile
        Will have 2 parts:
            Public part:
                * public-description (free text)
                * location
            Private:
                * fist name, last name, email address
                * private-description (free text for work history, skills etc)

    - Positions browsing view
        Displays a list of jobs with current open positions.
        Anyone can view this list, even if not logged in.
        If a user is logged in, she can apply for a job.
        (off course, jobs have 'detailed' and 'brief' views)
        List can be filtered in various ways:
            * required skills
            * posting age (in days)
            * list of offerers


    - 'my jobs' results view
        2 lists:
        * jobs I applied for
        * new positions that match 'myjobs' agent.
            User can delete jobs from this list, so they are
            not displayed in it again.

    - 'myjobs' agent definition
        Specify requirements for jobs, to be used by job
        agent:
            * skills
            * list of offerers (or all)
            * max distance from my location
    
for Oferres:
    
    - new/update  job
        A job offerer can specify a new, or updae a job offer.
            * job description
            * list of required skills
            * relevancy state (position still valid ?) (true/false)
        
    

    - new jobs/candidates view
        View lists my job-offers, and new users that applied for my offers.
        Offerer can remove candidates from a job on the list, so they are
        not displayed on this job again.
    

Skills:
    Each skill has a simple short description.
    A developer either has, or hasn't got a certain skill.
    A job either require, or doesn't require a certain skill.


Design:
    - design your angularjs services
        (name services, specify API in each service)
    - design client side filters you will need
      (describe each filter and give it a name)
    - describe in detail each view, specify how it should 
      interract with your services.
    - design your REST service
